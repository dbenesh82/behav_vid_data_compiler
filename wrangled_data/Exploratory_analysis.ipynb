    "All but two of the copepods from this plate were recorded on all 7 observation days. In these two cases, the copepod did not have the full set because it died before the end of the experiment. Neither was missing data on day 7, when the mystery copepod **39_1B** was observed. This was also the case for the other two mystery copepods, suggesting there is no reason to suspect typos for the occurence of these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three treatment groups in the experiment: infected copepods, exposed by uninfected copepods, and unexposed control copepods. My main interest was the infected copepods, so the behavior of all infected copepods was recorded. All controls were also recorded. There were just a couple controls per plate, because I exposed most copepods to maximize the number of infecteds available. The least interesting, yet most common group was the exposed but uninfected copepods. All three mystery copepods were in this group (this info is in a different table). Thus, I do not think they would have been chosen for behavioral processing. Rather, I think the videos for these copepods were recorded by accident. On the one hand, this is not problematic (more data is good). On the other hand, I plan to model variation in copepod behavior across days with mixed models, and these copepods will not contribute information to this end. Still, at least right now, I do not see a strong reason to exclude them.\n",

    "Now, let's combine the *behavior* and *videography* data tables. In the main *behavior* data frame, the first two columns record the observation number (starting from 0 or 1). Copepods were recorded for just over two minutes, with an observation taken every two seconds, hence the 62 observations per copepod per day. The `X` and `Y` variables record copepod position, and these coordinates are used to calculate the `Distance` moved by the copepod in each time interval. `Pixel Value` is simply how dark the tracked copepod appeared on the video. The three columns starting with `ok_` were created when compiling the dataset from individual txt files and flag cases of potential concern. The last three columns (`cop_name`, `day`, and `fname`) record the copepod id, the day post infection it was observed, and the file name containing the data for that copepod on that day."

For cases in which fewer observations were made than expected, it might be possible to re-analyze the videos and correct the values. For cases in which more observations are made than expected, we need to see if we can exclude the extra observations, such that the `slice` number is correct and comparable. In a couple cases, the remarks made by the person analyzing the videos are informative. For example, the video for copepods on plate 61 recorded on day 9 was incomplete (only 47 observations). But usually, when there were problems with the video, under remarks, only a \"?\" was given, indicating there were problems in observing the copepod. "
